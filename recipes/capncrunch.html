        <h2> A delicious and nutritous start to your day.</h2>
        <p>"Capn and cola, capn and malk, capn and glue - no other cereal will do."</p>
        <p> Those were the immortal words once sang by Carl "Captain" Crunch, in the earliest radio advertisements for what is now one of the world's greatest name brands. </p>
        <p> While the slogan may have changed (Crunchatize me Capn!) the fans have remained. Capn Crunch is the world's leading brand of men and women's hygeine products.</p>

        <h3> To Create:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> 
                <p>Using a pair of gilded chef's tweezers, delicately place each capsule of cronch into a vessel of your choosing.</p>
                <p>Possible choices include: 
                    <ul>
                        <li> An old shoe.</li>
                        <li> An empty box of Capn Crunch</li>
                        <li> Your gaping maw</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>With a lightly used (but thoroughly cleansed) syringe, inject each cronch with approximately .7 mg of 2%, non homogenized, cat's milk.</p>
