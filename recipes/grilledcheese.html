        <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
            <p>Bread. Cheese. Heat. Meat? No Meat*. </p>
            <p><em>*Sometimes meat</em></p>

        
        <h2><em>Ingredients:</em></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Artisinally baked, small batch Wonderbread(tm) from your local Walgreens.</li>
                <li>Freshly churned, risen, and homogenized <strong>American</strong> cheese.</li>
                <li>Butter, of any national variety, though preferably <strong>Canadian.</strong> </li>
            </ul>

        <h2> <em>Steps</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Find two of your finest slices of bread; lay them out parallel to eachother on a plate</li>
            <li>Give them a good talking to - let them know that they aren't all that, but soon they shall be</li>
            <li>Remove the shell from 4 slices of american cheese
                <li>In culinary circles, this process is known as <em>undressing the cheese</em></li>
            </li>
            <li>Using the classically derived stitching techniques of ancient Celtic art, softly but <strong>intentionally</strong> entertwine your cheese slices with eachother

            </li>
            <li>Over an open flame, bring a skillet to medium heat, and melt your butter within
                <li><em>Note: if an open flame is unavailable, an electric stovetop element will work in a pinch</em></li>
            </li>
            <li>Bring bread to bread in a glorious union, making what is known as an <em>"Grilled Cheese Tartare"</em></li>
            <li>Chuck that thang into your pan, and cook until golden brown on one side
                <li>Don't mooooove it! Let it get nice and golden.

                </li>
            </li>
            <li>Flip it over <em>before</em> it burns</li>
            <li>Remove from pan once cheese has melted, and slice diagonally</li>
            <li>Garnish with a puddle of warmed half n half, and freshly plucked stalks of wheat. Serve with a side of filet mignon, <em><strong>RARE</strong></em></li>
