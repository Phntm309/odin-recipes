        <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
            <p>Picture this if you will: </p>
            <p><em>The curtain rises to show a small man, beaten down by life, sitting with his head in his hands at his kitchen table.</em></p>
            <p>"Why!" the man cries, "Why can't I have my jelly beans? What have I done to deserve this?"</p>
            <p><em>Achingly, the man raises his hands, following them hungrily with his eyes, towards the clock hanging on his wall.</em></p>
            <p>"The night is young, the hour is but 2 AM,  yet all the shops are closed! My heart burns and bleeds for jellybeans, but alas, I am unable to purchase those sweet trifles of heavenly joy!"</p>
            <p> <em>If only our hero knew, just how easily he could synthesize these delights.</em></p>

        <h2><em>Ingredients:</em></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>One can of beans, any variety </li>
                <li>One jar of jelly, though jam will work in a pinch</li>
            </ul>

        <h2> <em>Steps</em></h2>
